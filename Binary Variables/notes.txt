Fixed Cost -> Doesn't take volume into consideration, AKA only added once

Let's say we have the continuous variable x,
To represent whether the variable x was used whatsoever, we

xx = 1_{{x > 0}}

such that :

1_{{.}} = { 1, if . is satisfied
          { 0, otherwise

And if x had a Fixed Cost (A) which was applied once, e.g. setup costs which is only 
 - applied. We can do as Follow

Maximize {(PROFIT * x) - (A * xx)}  

Auxiliary DV: Their values aren't independant, and they add no new info,
 - and thier values rely on other variables, also, they are used to write 
 - a simplify the formulation

Examples on Auxiliary DV:
 - F is a D.V. and F has a fixed cost of M. 
 - F <= [MaxCreationLimitForF] * FF.
 - FF is the Auxiliary DV.
