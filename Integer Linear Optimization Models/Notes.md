Types of integer linear program:
- All integer linear program:
    - All decision variables are integers.
- LP relaxation:
    - Problems where you can turn an ILP into an LP, by dropping integer constraint.
    - If the optimal decision variables solution for LP relaxation are Integer, then it is the optimal solution for the original ILP problem.
- Mixed Integer linear program:
    - Some decision variables are integers.
- Binary integer linear program:
    - The decision variables can only be either 0 or 1.

ALWAYS USE <= OR >=. DO NOT USE < OR > ONLY
