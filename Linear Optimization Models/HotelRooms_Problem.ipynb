    "Round Treeâ€™s management makes a forecast of the demand by rental class for each night in the future. A linear programming model developed to maximize profit is used to determine how many reservations to accept for each rental class. The demand forecast for a particular night is 130 rentals in  the Super Saver class, 60 in the Deluxe class, and 50 in the Business class. Since these are the forecasted demands, Round Tree will take no more than these amounts of each reservation for each rental class. Round Tree has a limited number of each type of room. There are 100 Type I rooms and 120 Type II rooms.\n",
