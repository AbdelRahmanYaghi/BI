    "## **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "A company has ten employees, seven machines, and thirty jobs to be completed. The time required \n",
    "to complete job ùëó by employee ùëí using machine ùëö is given and denoted by $ùë°_{ùëóùëíùëö}$. An employee can \n",
    "only perform one job at a time. Similarly, a machine can only execute one job at a time. A job \n",
    "cannot be divided among employees. Also, a job cannot be divided between machines. Develop a \n",
    "mathematical formulation that can be used to obtain the optimal job-employee-machine \n",
    "assignment if the company wants to minimize the total time spent by all machines to complete the \n",
    "seven jobs. Generate different scenarios and, using Cplex, implement and solve your formulation \n",
    "for these scenarios.\n",
