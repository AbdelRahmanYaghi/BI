LINEAR PROGRAMMING (Polynomial Time)
Decision Variables --> Continuous
Constraints --> Linear
Objective Function --> Linear

IF Decision VARIABLES ARE INTEGER, 
THEN IT IS INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING (Exponential Time) 

BI problems:
    A- Stochastic
    B- Determenistic
        a- Linear
            1- Linear Programming
            2- Integer Linear Programming
        b- NonLinear
            1- Non Linear Programming
            2- Integer Non Linear Programming
                x- B INLP


Special Cases of solutions:
    A- Alternative Optimal Solution
    B- Infeasibility
    C- Unbounded 

Convex (Linear) Combination:
    Any point between 2 points given by:
    Y = Lx1 + (1-L)x2,
    where L is lambda, any number between 0-1

Each constraint has a shadow price:
    Which is the rate/ or amount of change on the objective value
     for each [1] unit increase in the right hand side of a constraint.
     
Binding constraint:
    When the values of the optimal decision variable values in an constraint
     it will exactly be on the limit of that constraint. e.g.
        DV:  a = 2, b = 4.
        Constraint: 2a + 1b <= 8 ---> Binding Constraint

* Non Binding Constraint will always have a shadow price of 0.
