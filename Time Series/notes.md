Time series patterns:
1. Horizontal Pattern: The mean is equal over any time period
2. Trend: "Continuous?" Long Term Overall change, whether increasing or decreasing.
3. Seasonal Pattern: The Non-Random behaviour and pattern across a period of time.
4. Trend and Seasonal Pattern: 2+3
5. ...

A. Horizontal Pattern:
    - Stationary: Statistics are independent from the time variable.
      * Plotting a Stationary will always result in a Horizontal with minor changes.
      * E.g. Gasoline Problem

B. Trend Pattern:
    * E.g. Bicycle Sales
    * E.g. Cholesterol Drug Revenue

C. Seasonal Pattern:
    * E.g. Umbrella Sales

D. Trend and Seasonal Pattern:
    * E.g. Smartphone Sales

Exponential Smoothing closed form: $\hat{y}_{t+1} = \alpha \sum_{i=0}^{t-2}((1âˆ’\alpha)^{i}y_{t-i}) + (1-\alpha)^{t-1}y_1$
