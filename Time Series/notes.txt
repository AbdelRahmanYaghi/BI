Time series patterns:
1- Horizontal Pattern: The mean is equal over any time period
2- Trend : "Continuous?" Long Term Overall change, whether increasing or decreasing.
3- Seasonal Pattern: The Non-Random behaviour and pattern across a period of time.  
4- Trend and Seasonal Pattern: 2+3
5- ...

A- Horizontal Pattern:
  - Stationary: Statistics are independant from time variable.
    * Plotting a Stationary will always result in a Horizontal with minor changes.
    * E.g. Gasoline Problem

B- Trend Pattern:
    * E.g. Bicycle Sales
    * E.g. Cholesterol Drug Revenue

C- Seasonal Pattern:
    * E.g. Umbrella Sales

D- Trend and Seasonal Pattern:
    * E.g. Smartphone Sales

Exponintial Smoothing closed form: y^​t​= \sum_{i=1}^{t} ​(1−α)^{t−i}αy_{i−1​}+(1−α)^{t}y\_hat_{​0}​
