A- Horizental Pattern:
  - Stationary: Statistics are independant from time variable.
    * Plotting a Stationary will always result in a Horizental with minor changes.
    * E.g. Gasoline Problem

B- Trend Pattern:
    * E.g. Bicycle Sales
    * E.g. Cholesterol Drug Revenue

C- Seasonal Pattern:
    * E.g. Umbrella Sales

D- Trend and Seasonal Pattern:
    * E.g. Smartphone Sales
